However, Sadiq Khan who was sworn in as mayor of the British capital on Saturday, dismissed Trump\\u2019s response, saying the real estate billionaire and presumptive Republican nominee had an \\u201cignorant view of Islam\\u201d. \\u201cThere will always be exceptions,\\u201d the Times on Monday quoted Trump as saying when asked how his controversial proposal would apply to Khan, the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver and a seamstress. Trump said he was happy to see Khan elected, the Times reported, adding: \\u201cYou lead by example, always lead by example. If he does a good job ... that would be a terrific thing.\\u201d Trump put forth the idea of the ban after deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Paris and California last year. Muslim and human rights groups, Trump\\u2019s Democratic rivals and many of his Republican presidential opponents condemned the proposal as divisive, counter-productive and contrary to American values. Khan said Trump\\u2019s view risked alienating mainstream Muslims and played into the hands of extremists, making both Britain and the United States less secure. \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t just about me - it\\u2019s about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world,\\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday. \\u201cDonald Trump and those around him think that Western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam - London has proved him wrong.\\u201d Khan, 45, a candidate from the opposition Labour Party, defeated his Conservative rival by a record margin last week to secure the biggest individual mandate in British political history after an acrimonious campaign. After his victory, he accused his opponents of using fear and innuendo about his alleged links to extremists to turn ethnic and religious groups against each other, which he described as \\u201csomething straight out of the Donald Trump playbook\\u201d. In an interview with Time magazine, Khan said he wanted to go to the United States to see the interesting programmes the mayors of New York and Chicago were implementing, but that he would have to visit before January in case Trump won the Nov. 8 election.\",\n          \"President Donald Trump\\u2019s outspoken doubts about climate change and his administration\\u2019s efforts to roll back regulation to combat it have stirred a sleepy faction in U.S. politics: the Republican environmental movement. The various groups represent conservatives, Catholics and the younger generation of Republicans who, unlike Trump, not only recognize the science of climate change but want to see their party wrest the initiative from Democrats and lead efforts to combat global warming. Conservative green groups such as ConservAmerica and republicEn, along with politically neutral religious groups such as Catholic Climate Covenant and bipartisan groups such as the Citizens Climate Lobby, have ramped up efforts to recruit more congressional Republicans to work on addressing climate change since Trump\\u2019s election. Conservative environmental advocates promote what they call \\u201cfree enterprise\\u201d solutions to climate change, like a carbon tax. That stands in contrast to the approach of liberal environmentalists under former President Barack Obama, who backed bans on certain kinds of oil drilling and regulations aimed at discouraging petroleum use. But whatever their differences, the conservative groups say they have an important role to play. \\u201cConservatives now have a chance to earn back the trust of Americans on environmental issues,\\u201d said Alex Bozmoski, director of strategy for republicEn. \\u201cThey can lead in a completely different direction that actually grows the economy while cutting greenhouse gasses.\\u201d The activists\\u2019 efforts have not swayed anywhere near a majority yet on Capitol Hill. Only 20 or so of the 237 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have spoken out on climate change this year. But they hope to build a big enough bloc in Congress, or enough influence at the White House, to temper Trump\\u2019s agenda. Lobbying has yielded some early results: a pro-environment voting bloc in Congress, the Climate Solutions Caucus, for example, has signed on more Republicans in the last two months than in it had in the final year of Obama\\u2019s administration - its first year in existence. Urged on by a coalition of conservative and religious groups, including the Catholic Climate Covenant, a handful of additional Republicans have also signed a congressional resolution pledging to address climate change. The resolution was non-binding, but it represented a direct challenge to Trump\\u2019s climate stance, a high-profile signal of dissent within his party. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like Alcoholics Anonymous \\u2014 you\\u2019ve got to first recognize you\\u2019ve got a problem before you can deal with it,\\u201d said Mark Sanford, a Republican Congressman from South Carolina who signed the resolution. Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the more than 100-year-old Sierra Club environmental group, said she was happy to see \\u201cenlightened Republicans\\u201d beginning to act on climate change. But Pierce added, \\u201cLegislative action is a long time away based on, at least, the Republican leadership.\\u201d Pierce also said she was skeptical of free enterprise solutions advocated by conservative environmental groups like republicEn, which she said sounded to her like \\u201cwe have to pay them not to pollute.\\u201d Jose Aguto, associate director of the Catholic Climate Covenant, said Republicans are the only major political party in the world not convinced by climate change. \\u201cOnce they accept the reality and science of climate change, we will have reached a tipping point in the political will for solutions.\\u201d Trump has raised the hackles of many environmentalists since taking office. He has overturned several Obama-era environmental regulations, and last week he proposed slashing the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 31 percent. During his presidential campaign Trump called climate change a \\u201choax\\u201d and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a global pact to fight it \\u2013 tapping into a well of Republican concern that the United States\\u2019 energy habits would be policed by the United Nations. But Republican bias against climate science is out of step with the majority of Americans. A Reuters/Ipsos poll shows a majority of Republican supporters agree the United States should play a leading role in combating climate change. \\u201cIt shouldn\\u2019t surprise anyone that more and more Republicans are interested in this issue,\\u201d said Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida. \\u201cThis issue was regrettably politicized some 20 or so years ago, and we are in the process of taking some of the politics out.\\u201d On Feb. 8, representatives from a newly formed group of Republican statesmen, the Climate Leadership Council, including former Treasury secretaries Henry Paulson and James A. Baker, met with senior administration officials to push a carbon tax. \\u201cWe got a very respectful hearing,\\u201d said the council\\u2019s CEO, Ted Halstead. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve also been meeting with Republicans on the Hill and have found open minds.\\u201d The White House did not comment on the meetings. Billionaire Republican donor and environmental advocate Andy Sabin, meanwhile, said he has been speaking directly with White House officials in hope of becoming Trump\\u2019s unpaid climate change adviser \\u2013 modeled on the role of fellow billionaire Carl Icahn in advising Trump on regulation. Focusing on health concerns would be the most effective way to get Trump to try to slow climate change, said Sabin, a precious metals magnate. When asked about the chances of Sabin getting the position, a White House spokeswoman said, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have an announcement at this time.\\u201d Republican Senator James Inhofe incurred public ridicule two years ago after marching into the Capitol Building with a snowball, claiming the cold weather disproved Obama\\u2019s climate change claims. This year, republicEn used the incident as part of a humorous rallying call on Valentine\\u2019s Day. Volunteers delivered greeting cards to lawmakers quoting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in his former role as chief executive officer of Exxon, declaring climate change to be a serious risk warranting \\u201cthoughtful action.\\u201d Along with the card were coconut-coated cakes called Sno Balls, a photograph of Inhofe and a poem: \\u201cRoses are red, snowballs are white, together we\\u2019ll get the solution right.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Video footage of the altercation on Monday, which was posted on the Internet, shows Time magazine photographer Christopher Morris getting close to the agent, who threw him to the ground and Morris kicking the agent from the floor. The magazine said Morris was knocked to the ground after stepping out of the press hold to take a picture of protesters. A Trump campaign spokeswoman acknowledged the incident, but said the campaign was not aware of the details. In a statement published in Time, Morris said he had covered the White House for nine years without altercations with the Secret Service. \\u201cThe rules at Trump events are significantly stricter than other campaigns and make it very difficult to work as a photographer, as many others have pointed out before me,\\u201d Morris said. \\u201cI regret my role in the confrontation, but the agent\\u2019s response was disproportionate and unnecessarily violent.\\u201d Free speech advocates have decried Trump\\u2019s treatment of protesters and reporters at his rallies, including ushering out dissenters and shouting at the press. The Secret Service said it would never intervene to quiet protesters or restrict journalists unless there was a public safety matter. \\u201cThe Secret Service\\u2019s role is to protect the candidate and the public,\\u201d Dye said. \\u201c(Agents are) not in any way responsible for removing protesters. We have a strong commitment to upholding the First Amendment.\\u201d Trump and Ben Carson are the only two Republican presidential contenders to receive Secret Service protection, along with Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Candidates must request the coverage. White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Tuesday acknowledged that the Secret Service has indicated it would \\u201clook at this particular situation.\\u201d\",\n          \"Kosovo s center-right coalition led by the Democratic Party of Kosovo signed a deal on Monday with the small New Alliance for Kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on June 11. Finally Kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed, said Ramush Haradinaj, from the center-right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998-99 war against Serb forces. Under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120-seat parliament. President Hashim Thaci is expected to give Haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. A source who asked not to be named told Reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. Haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the United Nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005. The smaller New Alliance for Kosovo party is led by Behgjet Pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest Kosovar. Pacolli, who also holds a Swiss passport, won many contracts from the Russian government to rebuild state buildings in Moscow in the 90s but a decade ago he moved his business from Moscow to Kazakhstan. It is unclear what post Pacolli will hold in the new government. The new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with Kosovo s neighbors, especially Serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the European Union accession process. It must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 Kosovo Serbs who do not recognize independence. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"October 6, 2016\",\n          \"June 10, 2017\",\n          \"Sep 13, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\",\n          \"0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
