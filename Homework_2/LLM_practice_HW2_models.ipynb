Apparently, Trump only believes polls are fake when the numbers are against him.For instance, his approval rating is the lowest for any president since 1945 in the first 100 days. And most Americans don t trust him.Trump also liked the part of the poll that suggests he would win the popular vote if the election were held again.New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative.

The Obama administration on Wednesday unveiled its final version of a retirement advice rule aimed at ensuring that broker-dealers put their clients\\u2019 interests ahead of their own profits, though it was softened in response to industry complaints. Vanguard, a major manager of retirement investments that oversees more than $3 trillion in assets, had criticized an earlier version of the proposal as being applied too broadly to its activities and to situations in which investors would not reasonably expect that they were receiving investment advice. Yet Vanguard said the new rule makes disclosure and contract requirements \\u201cmore practical and easier to follow.\\u201d \\u201cAll of the effort within the industry to improve the DOL proposal appears to have produced positive results,\\u201d according to John Schadl, a member of the company\\u2019s legal department, according to a statement also posted online. The company praised the government\\u2019s efforts to align its rules better with existing standards laid out by other regulatory bodies, although Vanguard said \\u201cthe DOL could have done more to harmonize these standards.\\u201d The Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based company said it has not fully reviewed the 1,023 pages of rules the department released. \\u201cIt is almost certain that we will find provisions of the new rule that will adversely affect some within the industry,\\u201d Schadl said in the statement. \",\n          \"Republican strategist Cheri Jacobus, who has appeared as a pundit on Fox News, filed a $4m defamation lawsuit on Monday in New York City against Donald Trump and his campaign (shocker). The suit alleges that the frontrunner and his campaign manager, woman batterer Corey Lewandowski, engaged in defamation aimed  with the purpose of making her an object lesson, to those who might question Trump and his fitness for office, to incite a virtual mob against her, to destroy her reputation, and to bully her. The bullying tactics occurred after Jacobus criticized the frontrunner on TV and Twitter. Jacobus approached the Trump campaign with the hopes of obtaining a job as communications director, but decided against it after finding Lewandowski  unprofessional  and a  powder keg,  meaning a dangerous or volatile person or situation.Well, Trump didn t like that. After she made her criticism public, Trump sent off the first hate-tweet, calling Jacobus  a real dummy.  When Jacobus attempted to reign in the drama with a cease-and-desist letter, the frontrunner took to Twitter yet again, referring to her as a  Major loser,  with zero credibility. Lewandowski then went on MSNBC to discredit Jacobus, saying: This is the same person, I ll just tell ya, who came to the office on multiple occasions trying to get a job from the Trump campaign, and when she wasn t hired clearly she went off and was upset by that. After that, Jacobus starting getting threatening, harassing hate mail from Trump supporters, and Fox News stonewalled the strategist. Jacobus also shows that Trump, who is friends with Roger Ailes, helped convince the network to drop her from appearing on their cable news programs. According to Jacobus, Lewandowski showed her the email where Ailes promised to be on Trump s side, not hers.So, Donald Trump resorted to bullying and intimidation to silence a female strategist who didn t agree with him? I m shocked I tell you, shocked! And of course the Trump campaign brushed off the lawsuit as  just another frivolous lawsuit and an attempt to gain notoriety at the expense of Donald Trump. Much like everything else, the Trump campaign just brushes everything off, and his band of backwards thinking supporters will eat it up.

six months since the 2016 election concluded in november, but trump is still under the delusion that he won the popular vote and is insisting that he would still win if another election were held.in a pair of tweets on sunday, trump declared that the abc news/washington post poll is  fake news  even though the poll showed that most trump supporters don t regret their vote and that a slim majority approve of his foreign policy and his pressure on american companies to keep jobs here. apparently, trump only believes polls are fake when the numbers are against him.for instance, his approval rating is the lowest for any president since 1945 in the first 100 days. and most americans don t trust him.trump also liked the part of the poll that suggests he would win the popular vote if the election were held again.new polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is fake and almost always negative. would still beat hillary in  ..  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump)

2017the problem is that trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes in 2016 despite low voter turnout by democrats and a protest vote against hillary in favor of third party candidates.twitter users didn t wait long to put trump in his place.@realdonaldtrump  would still beat hillary in the popular vote  you never beat hillary in the popular vote. how do people take you seriously?!  william legate (@williamlegate) april 23, 2017@realdonaldtrump you didn t win the popular vote.???? btw, where is all the evidence of those  3 million illegal votes ? we re waiting.

meaningful protections for retirement investors while making the final rule more workable,\\u201d mcnabb said in a statement posted online. the obama administration on wednesday unveiled its final version of a retirement advice rule aimed at ensuring that broker-dealers put their clients\\u2019 interests ahead of their own profits, though it was softened in response to industry complaints. vanguard, a major manager of retirement investments that oversees more than $3 trillion in assets, had criticized an earlier version of the proposal as being applied too broadly to its activities and to situations in which investors would not reasonably expect that they were receiving investment advice. yet vanguard said the new rule makes disclosure and contract requirements \\u201cmore practical and easier to follow.\\u201d \\u201call of the effort within the industry to improve the dol proposal appears to have produced positive results,\\u201d according to john schadl, a member of the company\\u2019s legal department, according to a statement also posted online. the company praised the government\\u2019s efforts to align its rules better with existing standards laid out by other regulatory bodies, although vanguard said \\u201cthe dol could have done more to harmonize these standards.\\u201d the valley forge, pennsylvania-based company said it has not fully reviewed the 1,023 pages of rules the department released. \\u201cit is almost certain that we will find provisions of the new rule that will adversely affect some within the industry,\\u201d schadl said in the
